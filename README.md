# OSOC Selection Tool

_Due to an issue in github markdown files we can't link you directly to the content (images get rendered after you go to the link, so all the content gets pushed down and the content you were first redirected to is now pushed down)._ 

_To get around this we redirect you to the table of contents, with at the top fo your view the link to the content you want to see._

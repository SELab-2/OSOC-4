## 1. Introduction
In this manual we'll explain everything there is to explain about the OSOC selection tool we've created. Going from installation and configuration, to usage of the selection tool. And we'll even go as far as showing you how to further develop this tool.



## 2. Product information
This manual concerns the Open Summer Of Code Selection tool, version 2.



## 3. Intended use
The tool is intended to be (and made to be) used by the selection-team of OSOC. With this we mean the people of OSOC itself that will supervise and conduct the selection-process (they are intended to be admins within our tool). And the people that will help the selection process by suggesting students (the coaches). These coaches will have to be invited every year, as these people mostly differ from edition to edition. 



## 4. Installation guide

### 4.1. Configuration
While developing or before installing you can use your own environment variables by using a .env file in the backend and/or frontend directory of the application. 

An example .env file for the backend directory of the application (IP-addresses may need to be changed):
```
# Mongo
MONGO_URL=192.168.0.102
MONGO_PORT=27017
MONGO_USER=root
MONGO_PASSWORD=justapassword

# Redis
REDIS_URL=192.168.0.102
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=justapassword

# SMTP Mail
SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_SSL_PORT=465
SENDER_EMAIL=osoc.groep4@gmail.com
SENDER_PASSWORD=Justapassword123!

# Invite Settings
INVITE_EXPIRE=4320 # in minutes
PASSWORDRESET_EXPIRE=30 # in minutes
```

An example .env file for the frontend directory of the application:
```
NEXT_BASE_PATH=""
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/auth"
NEXT_API_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8000"
NEXT_INTERNAL_API_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8000"
NODE_ENV="development"  # or production
```


### 4.2. Requirements
- Docker (installation guide: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Docker Compose (installation guide: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

If you want to run docker without sudo, we recommend you check here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/

### 4.3. Local installation

You first need to clone the repository that contains the code for the selection tool:

_with SSH, recommended_
```
git clone git@github.com:SELab-2/OSOC-4.git OSOC-selection-tool
cd OSOC-selection-tool
```

_with HTTPS_
```
git clone https://github.com/SELab-2/OSOC-4.git OSOC-selection-tool
cd OSOC-selection-tool
```

Now you need to start the application:
```
docker-compose up -d --build
```

If you want to restart all services you can use:
```
docker-compose restart
```

If you only want to restart one service, use one of the following commands:

`docker restart osoc-backend`

`docker restart osoc-mongodb`

`docker restart osoc-redis`

`docker restart osoc-frontend`

If you want to stop all services you can use
```
docker-compose down
```

### 4.4. Automatic deployment
Github Actions are used to automatically deploy the new codebase from the master or development branch to the server. A seperate docker-compose file is used by the Github Actions to deploy the application to the production server. This docker-compose file is made so the frontend and backend use the correct paths. This is needed because subdomains can't be used in the UGent network. Instead we use an extra prefixpath (/frontend and /api).

These branch versions of the application can be accessed by:
```
frontend: https://sel2-4.ugent.be/{branchname}/frontend
backend-api: https://sel2-4.ugent.be/{branchname}/api
```



## 5. How to further develop & test

## 5.1 Further development

You can find the Swagger API docs on `http://localhost:8000/docs` (change the port if needed). These docs describe what requests you can make to the API (backend), and what type of body the request expects (if a body is needed for that request).

## 5.2 Testing

Tests will run automatically with github actions but can be run locally too. There is a seperate docker-compose file for the test containers so they won't interfere with the running containers for the development or production. The containers used for testing don't map there ports to the host machine so they can't be accessed by the internet for security.

Run backend (API) tests:
```
docker-compose -f test-docker-compose.yml up --build -d # this starts the test database and test redis server
docker-compose -f test-docker-compose.yml run test-osoc-backend python -m unittest discover # This executes the python -m ... command in the backend container
docker-compose down  # this stops the container again
```

Run frontend tests: \
Tests can be run once using the command `yarn test`. If you want to run tests in watch mode or want more detailed output use `yarn test_watch` or yarn `test --watch-all --verbose`.



## 6. Architecture and Design
Now we're going to describe the architecture and design of the OSOC selection tool.

In order to deploy everything, we use Docker. Using containers allows us to have
an easily reproducible deployment. We have a seperate container for the
database (PostgreSQL), the Redis, the backend (FastAPI) and the frontend (Next.js). This allows us to develop and scale
each part of our application separately.

![Architecture](architecture_and_design/containers.svg)

The design of our application is a very standard client-server architecture. A frontend is
used to access a backend, both of which are deployed on a server (as shown above). The frontend is
accessed through a reverse proxy. This is provided through Traefik. Traefik also
provides a dashboard that allows us to monitor all the services.

![Design](architecture_and_design/design.svg)

The backend can then access data, which is stored using PostgreSQL and Redis.
Redis has built in features to let data automaticaly expire and is thus used
for user invites, password resets and revokable tokens. PostgreSQL is used for
everything else. This way the frontend doesn't have direct access to the
database, all operations on the database are defined and controlled by the backend.

Something noticable is that the frontend can send back to the reverse proxy (which will only go to the backend) but it can also send requests straight to the backend. This is because of Next.js. Next.js offers multiple ways to render pages, one is just normal client side rendering and the other we use is server side rendering. With client side rendering the requests will need to go through the proxy (Traefik). But when server side rendering is used for a page (there aren't many pages that use this since almost everything needs to update at real time), the request goes straight from the frontend to the backend, thereby skipping the proxy.

There is no support yet for github, but that will be added in a later version. There also is no 2FA, but it may be added in later versions.

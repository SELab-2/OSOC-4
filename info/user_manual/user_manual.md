## 1. Introduction
In this manual we'll explain everything there is to explain about the OSOC selection tool we've created. Going from installation and configuration, to usage of the version 1 selection tool. And we'll even go as far as showing you how to further develop this handy tool.


## 2. Product information
This manual concerns the Open Summer Of Code Selection tool, version 1


## 3. Intended use
The tool is intended to be (and made to be) used by the selection-team of OSOC. With this we mean the people of OSOC itself that will supervise and conduct the selection-process (they are intended to be admins within our tool). And the people that will help the selection process by suggesting students (the coaches). These coaches will have to be invited every year, as these people mostly differ from edition to edition.

First of all we have a login system. If you already have an account on the tool (see the next section 'invite system' if you want to know how to obtain an account), you need to provide your email-adress and password in order to login. There is no support yet for github, but that will be added in a later version. There also is no 2FA, but it may be added in later versions.


### 4.2. Architecture and Design
Now we're going to describe the architecture of how the OSOC selection tool works. 

We're basicly using 4 containers (redis, mongodb, backend, frontend)

*hier komt een prentje*

Now we will describe how all these containers work toghetter in order to archieve a fully working selection tool.

![Design](https://github.com/SELab-2/OSOC-4/blob/user_man/info/deployment/deployment.svg)


## 5. Description of the user interface and common use cases

### 5.1 Login screen

![Login screen](https://github.com/SELab-2/OSOC-4/blob/user_man/info/screenshots/login_screen.png)

Before logging in, your profile must be approved by an admin.
1. A field to write your email address that is linked to your profile.
2. A field to write your password to enter the application.
3. This button will give you access to the application if the email address and password match a valid profile. Otherwise, you will get a warning message.
4. If you forgot your password, this button will send you an email to reset your password.

## 6. Configuration
While developing or before installing you can use your own environment variables by using a .env file in the backend directory of the application. It should look like this:
```
# Mongo
MONGO_URL=192.168.0.102
MONGO_PORT=27017
MONGO_USER=root
MONGO_PASSWORD=justapassword

# Redis
REDIS_URL=192.168.0.102
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=justapassword

# SMTP Mail
SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_SSL_PORT=465
SENDER_EMAIL=osoc.groep4@gmail.com
SENDER_PASSWORD=Justapassword123!

# Invite Settings
INVITE_EXPIRE=4320 # in minutes
PASSWORDRESET_EXPIRE=30 # in minutes
```

## 7. Installation-instructions

### 7.1. Local installation

#### 7.1.1. Requirements
- Docker (installation guide: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Docker Compose (installation guide: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

If you want to run docker without sudo, we recommend you check here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/

#### 7.1.2. Local installation

You first need to clone the repository that contains the code for the selection tool:
```
git clone https://github.com/SELab-2/OSOC-4.git OSOC-selection-tool
cd OSOC-selection-tool
```

Now you need to start the application:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

If you made some changes to the code, it is important that you rebuild, use the following command for that:
```
docker-compose up -d --build
```


If you want to restart all services you can use:
```
docker-compose restart
```

If you only want to restart one service, use one of the following commands:

`docker restart osoc-backend`

`docker restart osoc-mongodb`

`docker restart osoc-redis`

`docker restart osoc-frontend`

If you want to stop all services you can use
```
docker-compose down
```

### 7.2. Automatic deployment
Github Actions are used to automatically deploy the new codebase from the master or development branch to the server. A seperate docker-compose file is used by the Github Actions to deploy the application to the production server. This docker-compose file is made so the frontend and backend use the correct paths. This is needed because subdomains can't be used in the UGent network. Instead we use an extra prefixpath (/frontend and /api).

These branch versions of the application can be accessed by:
```
frontend: https://sel2-4.ugent.be/{branchname}/frontend
backend-api: https://sel2-4.ugent.be/{branchname}/api
```

## 8. Testing
Tests will run automatically with github actions but can be run locally too. There is a seperate docker-compose file for the test containers so they won't interfere with the running containers for the development or production. The containers used for testing don't map there ports to the host machine so they can't be accessed by the internet for security.

```
docker-compose -f test-docker-compose.yml up --build -d # this starts the test database and test redis server
docker-compose -f test-docker-compose.yml run test-osoc-backend python -m unittest discover # This executes the python -m ... command in the backend container
docker-compose down  # this stops the container again
```

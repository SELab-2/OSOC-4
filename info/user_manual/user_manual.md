## 1. Introduction
In this manual we'll explain everything there is to explain about the tool we've created. Going from installation and configuration, to usage of the version 1 selection tool. And we'll even go as far as showing you how to further develop this handy tool.

## 2. Product information
This manual concerns the OSOC Selection tool version 1

## 3. Intended use
The tool is intended to be (and made to be) used by the selection-team of OSOC. With this we mean the people of OSOC itself that will supervise and conduct the selection-process (they are intended to be admins within our tool). And the people that will help the selection process by suggesting students (the coaches). These coaches will have to be invited every year, as these people mostly differ from edition to edition.
